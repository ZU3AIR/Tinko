TINKO - Tap, Link & Go

TINKO is a mobile app that utilises NFC tags granting the user the ability to easily connect between people in casual social and professional work environments.
You would be able to meet new people and stay connected just by a tap.

This application will give users the ability to connect with others with just a tap of their
phone utilizing NFC technology. The user will have the ability to choose between a variety of
sharing options, such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Emails, Mobile Number etc. The application has a minimalistic and attractive user
interface. This application eliminates two things; Firstly it eliminates the need for the
user to go and manually find their usernames for different platforms. Secondly it
eliminates having to add the received data from the user manually, making the job of the
recipient easier.

The inspiration behind this application came from our personal experiences of visiting career
fairs. When in a busy, and somewhat hectic environment you become forgetful of the idea of
connecting with the speakers or fellow like minded individuals at the venues or you share one
platform rather than a more suitable one for that moment such as an email instead of
LinkedIn at a careers fair.
