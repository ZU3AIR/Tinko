TINKO - Tap, Link & Go

TINKO is a mobile app that utilises NFC tags granting the user the ability to easily connect between people in casual social and professional work environments.
You would be able to meet new people and stay connected just by a tap.

This application will give users the ability to connect with others with just a tap of their
phone utilizing NFC technology. The user will have the ability to choose between a variety of
sharing options, such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Emails, Mobile Number etc. The user could
choose to have multiple presets for different social environments, such as professional work
to recreational environments. The application will have a minimalistic and attractive user
interface. This application will eliminate two things; Firstly it will eliminate the need for the
user to go and manually find their usernames for different platforms. Secondly it will
eliminate having to add the received data from the user manually, making the job of the
recipient easier.
